# Code Review

Code review written by [Theo Sandell](https://github.com/theo0165).

1. `connection.php:10` - Connect function can return PDO object instead of generic object.
2. `connection.php:10` - Database object should be saved to class variable, this way there is no need to connect to database every time a request is needed.
3. `functions.php:13` - $time variable is not used and not needed
4. `/components` - This folder has mixed pages, both full pages and headers/footers. Full pages should be split into separate folder.
5. `index.php:9` - Header should be placed in header.php, same with the navbar. That way you only need to include header.php, not header.php and create a header tag with navbar.
6. `fetch.php:7`, `connection.php:5` - Classes should have capitalized first letter for readability.
7. `fetch.php:7-62` - These functions should be placed in functions.php

##### Nitpicking
